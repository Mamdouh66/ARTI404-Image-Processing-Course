# ARTI404: Image Processing Labs

This repository will hold my solutions to the ARTI404 Image Processing Labs. 
This repository contains a series of lab exercises and solutions that explore various aspects of image processing using different tools and libraries.

## Description

The labs complement the theoretical knowledge gained in ARTI404, covering a range of topics from basic image manipulation to advanced image analysis techniques. Key concepts include two-dimensional data representation, time and frequency domain representations, filtering, enhancement, and more.

## Labs

- Lab 01: Basics of programming with Python
- Lab 02: Basics Operations on Image

## Installation

To run the lab solutions on your local machine, you will need to set up your environment first.
